title: "About me"

---

Hello! I'm a Master's student in the biostatistics department at the University of Washington. I received my Bachelor's degree in Data Science and Molecular Biology from the University of California, Santa Barbara.

I had a summer internship at Staidson Biopharma Inc where I was responsible for cleaning the clinical data from a COVID-19 study. A few side projects that I'm working on include differential analysis for tumor cells with and without the stimulation of IFN-beta; and a machine learning model that explores the potential cause of poverty.
